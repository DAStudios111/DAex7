                some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information

                please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our
                facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see &#34;WHEN
                AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?&#34; above), in the United States, and other
                countries.<br /><br />If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK),
                then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as
                comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your
                personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.<br /><br />European
                Commission&#39;s Standard Contractual Clauses:<br /><br />We have implemented measures to protect your
                personal information, including by using the European Commission&#39;s Standard Contractual Clauses for
                transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party
                providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process
                originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our
                Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate

                necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required
                or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice
                will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.<br /><br />When we have no
                ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
                anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
                has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate
                it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br /><br />8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION
                SAFE?<br /><br />In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                organizational and technical security measures.<br /><br />We have implemented appropriate and
                reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
                personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
                no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
                100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third

                information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
                information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a

                you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor

                for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other
                non-marketing purposes.<br /><br />Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept
                cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to

                FEATURES<br /><br />Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include
                a Do-Not-Track (&#34;DNT&#34;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
                to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform
                technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.<br /><br />12.
